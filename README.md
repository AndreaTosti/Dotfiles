### Polybar

![Polybar Preview](Polybar_preview.png?raw=true "Polybar Preview")

Both scripts and themes were taken from:

* [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes)
* [polybar scripts](https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts)
* [langurmonkey](https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/dotfiles/blob/master/polybar/scripts/memory.sh)

and then modified:

* by putting a central bar to be used together with KDE Plasma
* I added padding to the texts (quickly, without much care) in order to maintain the fixed size of the modules
* i chose a monospace font for the same reason as the previous point

#### **Note** about display resolution, edit polybar_config:
* **[1920x1080]** `width = 60%`, `offset-x = 20%` (*default*)
* **[1600x&nbsp;&nbsp;900]** `width = 68%`, `offset-x = 16%`
* **[1368x&nbsp;&nbsp;768]** `width = 80%`, `offset-x = 10%`
